    Founded in 2012, <a href="http://www.canva.com">Canva</a> originated as a simpler alternative to Photoshop, allowing students and professionals to create graphic design illustrations without a steep learning curve. 
    Though Canva is mostly used for promotional design (it's very popular among librarians), it does feature an array of UX design tools.
