Suggestions for improvement:
<ol>
<li>Easy “back” or “reset” button</li>
<li>Loading/progress bars</li>
<li>Easier way to look up <i>Tower</i> articles, via drop down menu</li>
<li>More intuitive categorization of scanned newspapers</li>
</ol> 
</p>
    <p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">The heuristic analysis that I conducted, and the usability test done by my friend which I oversaw, yielded mostly the same results.
    Though the <i>Tower</i> archive usefully provides many decades worth of historical records, the poor user interface, long load times, and incongruity of links and documents makes searching the database a confusing and sometimes frustrating experience.
    Were the university to go back to fix the archive, should be a focus on consistency in the timeline - say, both a "next" button that takes users to the scanned paper immediately
    chronologically after the one they're viewing, and links to papers grouped by decade on each page - and error prevention taking the form of at least warning users that some links might not work.
    There should be a way to immediately go back to the start of the <i>Tower</i> archive, instead of the link on top only taking users to the main university libraries page. </p>
