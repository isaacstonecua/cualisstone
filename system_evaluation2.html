<h3><h3 style="color:white;">	In the tradition of Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive, <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts">Sefaria</a> was conceived as an idea in 2011 and created in 2012 as an open-source archive of Judaica - "3,000 years of Jewish texts," in their words. In 2017, the entirety of the Babylonian Talmud was added to its database. Developed by former Google manager Brett Lockspeiser and author Joshua Foer, the database has since grown to encompass a huge variety of ancient and modern sources from the Jewish tradition. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Tanakh">Tanakh (Old Testament)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Mishnah">Mishna (third century Jewish law)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Talmud">Talmud (Rabbinic commentary and law, 3rd-8th centuries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Midrash">Midrash (biblical exegesis)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Halakhah">Halakha (legal writing)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Kabbalah">Kabbalah (mysticism)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Liturgy">Liturgy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Jewish%20Thought">Jewish thought</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Tosefta">Tosefta (companion to the Mishna)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Chasidut">Chasidut (teachings of the 18th century thinker, the Baal Shem Tov)</li></a>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Musar">Musar (instruction for moral and spiritual character)</li></a>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Responsa">Responsa (answers and rulings by Rabbinic leaders)</li></a>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Second%20Temple">Second Temple-era literature</li></a>
<li><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Reference">Reference sources</li></a>
</ul>
Additionally, the library hosts a <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/community">community section</a>, featuring commentary and opinion from rabbis, academics, and lay leaders. The site also includes special resources for <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/educators">educators</a> to use.
<p>
The target demographics for Sefaria are wide-ranging. They include religious leaders; academic; rabbinical, cantoral, and doctoral students; and anyone from any background interested in Jewish history and thought. In the decade since its creation, the database has received high praise from Jewish community leaders; writing in the <i>Kansas City Jewish Chronicle</i>, Rabbi David Glickman <a href="https://www.kcjc.com/opinions/1824-archived-opinion/5835-the-online-jewish-learning-revolution-sefaria-and-podcasts">calls</a> Sefaria "[the] greatest revolution in Jewish publications since David Bomberg mass-produced the Talmud on a printing press in the 1520s.</p>
<p>
The site is extremely intuitive and easy-to-use, with a minimalist design that makes it feel as if Google or YouTube were designed by a committee of rabbis. The technical aspects of the online library are indeed impressive; it allows for one to engage in the kind of Torah study that would have, in an earlier era, been difficult to achieve in a solitary settings - comparing multiple texts, visualizing word usage, offering multiple translation options. I do think the solitary learning aspect could be taken even further - I think it would be a boon to eventually include video lectures within the library with which students could study along, plus maybe some Duolingo-esque interaction, particularly for learning to read and understand Hebrew or Aramaic. The library does maintain an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SefariaProject/videos">active YouTube presence</a> - maybe some more integration with the main library? But that's a very minor quibble. As someone who is a product of Jewish schools, I can only imagine how much easier Talmud study would have been for me to grasp had there been an online resource as easy-to-use as Sefaria available for me back then.
