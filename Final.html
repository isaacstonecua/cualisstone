    <h2><u>Systems Analysis</u></h2>

  <p>Among libraries in Washington, DC, the DC Jail Library is one-of-a-kind. Since its founding in 2015, it has served residents at the DC Jail’s two correctional facilities: the Central Detention Facility (CDF) and the Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF). Stemming from a long history of controversies regarding the jail’s lackluster facilities and operations, the DC Department of Corrections (DCDOC) has launched plans to replace the DC Jail with a new facility. According to the DCDOC’s website, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has allocated $463 million in the city’s FY 2025-FY 2030 capital budget proposal to design and construct this new, “state-of-the-art” correctional facility. A Washington Post article reported that it would take at least a decade for the city to complete this “ambitious, overdue effort to transform a troubled facility into a rehabilitative space” (Gathright, 2024). This proposed plan means that there is an opportunity for major changes to be made to the DC Jail Library’s current library system. These changes have the potential to align with the new DC Jail’s mission, “to modernize its approach to justice and confinement so those confined will be better prepared to reenter the community and change the trajectory of their lives.” (DCDOC, 2024). </p>
<p>In order to understand why and how to make changes to the DC Jail Library, it is imperative to first understand its current system. The DC Jail Library is an example of a system that is limited by design. It is one of the 26 branches of the DC Public Library (DCPL), but entirely unique in its operation. </p>
  <p>Like all branches of the DC Public Library, the DC Jail Library is supported by the SirsiDynix library management system. Formed in 2005 by the merger of the Sirsi Corporation and the Dynix Corporation, SirsiDynix is one of the largest providers of library technology services in the world, utilized at over 23,000 libraries in over 70 countries. Supported by the SirsiDynix system, the DCPL is able to offer patrons access to over 7,000 publications, eBook and movie rentals, language learning resources and much more. However, the patrons at the DC Jail Library are unable to benefit from these services, because they are not permitted to access them. In fact, patrons of the DC Jail Library rarely interact with the digital system itself.  </p>
  <p>Since its inception in 2015, the DC Jail Library has been a collaborative institution, managed by both the DC Public Library and the Department of Corrections. Richard Reyes-Gavilan, Executive Director of the DCPL, spoke about the challenges faced by two very different organizations working together: “We’re all about openness and democracy, and everything goes. And the jail is about limits and rules and laws and regulations … But we had a similar goal, so I think in some ways we both adapted to the culture of the other to get [the library] up and running.” (Boyle, 2015). </p>
  <p>There is no better example of the DC Jail Library’s unconventional place in the wider DCPL organization than its early days. The DC Jail Library officially opened in the winter of 2015 with a collection of 2,500 books (Boyle, 2015). DC Jail Librarian Danielle Zoller reported only using printed-out Excel spreadsheets and color-coded stickers to keep track of what materials patrons had checked out. A more technologically advanced system was not in use upon launch, but eventually the DC Jail Library joined the rest of DCPL and adopted the SirsiDynix system. However, there are still many aspects of the DC Jail Library’s use of this system that sets it apart from the rest of DCPL. According to Zoller, books are checked out to the housing unit of the borrower in SirsiDynix, rather than the borrower themselves. The library staff keeps track of individual inmates who check out books by recording names and barcodes in physical spreadsheets.</p>
  <p>The DC Jail library occupies a physical space in the DC Jail’s Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF), and its collection has grown to over 10,000 books (Janezich, 2017). Inmates housed in the CTF were once able to visit the library and check out books, although this practice is no longer in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DCPL employee Jean Badalamenti, the DC Jail Library staff makes regular rounds with a book cart, alternating each week between serving the CDF and the CTF. Inmates can make requests with their tablets, or through their case managers. Inmates are not permitted to search the library’s catalog, but they can ask the librarians about contents of the collection, and request books either through their tablets or their case managers. If the library does not carry a requested book, the librarians will loan out the next closest book at their discretion. Inmates can check out up to two books at a time for a two-week checkout duration, with the option to renew at the end of the two weeks. </p>
  <p>The tablets the inmates use are part of a policy launched in 2023, in which the DC Jail began providing free tablets to inmates in the CDF and CTF. Although the tablets themselves are free, there are still many services provided by the tablets that cost money. Therefore, an inmate may prefer to borrow a physical book from the library, rather than pay to rent an eBook. Inmates at the DC Jail have limited connectivity access through these tablets, and there is no open internet access available. </p>
  <p>Many aspects of the DC Jail’s system are sensible considering the transient nature of the DC Jail. The majority of inmates in the DC Jail are awaiting adjudication or serving time for misdemeanor offenses, meaning that, in theory, no one person should stay at the jail for very long. Therefore, it is easier for the library staff to check out books to housing units, rather than making individual accounts for each user. However, this contributes to a foundational element of the DC Jail that separates its patrons from the general public who patronize other DC public libraries. One of the DC Jail Library’s programs is to provide inmates with a library card upon release from jail. On one hand, this program is admirable because it provides patrons with immediate access to a more expansive selection of library resources as they are navigating reintegration into society. On the other, the stipulation that inmates are not permitted to have a library card while residing at the DC Jail demonstrates a further limit to what the system is allowed to accomplish. </p>
  <p>One final program worth noting is the DC Jail Video Visitation program offered by the DC Public Library. This program allows users to virtually meet with friends and loved ones incarcerated in the DC Jail. Although not an official part of the DC Jail Library’s system, the DC Jail Video Visitation program marks another form of collaboration between the DC Public Library and the DC Department of Corrections. Furthermore, it is programming facilitated by the larger DCPL system that affects the day-to-day lives of inmates and their families.</p>
