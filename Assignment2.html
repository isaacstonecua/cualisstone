    Founded in 2012, <a href="http://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> originated as a simpler alternative to Photoshop, allowing students and professionals to create graphic design illustrations without a steep learning curve. 
    Though Canva is mostly used for promotional design (it's very popular among librarians), it does feature an array of UX design tools.
  </p>
  <p>Canva's basic features - its templates, stock photos, and editing and design features, are free to use, while its AI features and more
  business-friendly elements are part of paid plans, often provided by organizations. As Rosenberg et. al. write of Gustavus Adolphus College's website in <i>Information Architecture</i>,
  "You can't help but notice the site's colors, typeface choices, and photographs" (p. 80). <!--- Rosenfeld, L., Morville, P., & Arango, J. (2015). Information Architecture: for the web and beyond. https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25891169M/Information_Architecture ---> The designs created by Canva most likely will not be complex,
  but they are attractive options for novice designers who need something eye-catching yet simple to draw an audience. It should be noted that Canva itself
  is extremely easy to use, recalling Powerpoint even more than the Adobe software for which it was built as an alternative. The service itself is a testament to Nielsen's
  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flexibility-efficiency-heuristic/" target="_blank">seventh heuristic</a>, "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use".</p>
<p>Canva has multiple features that are useful for information architecture and UX design. There's the <a href="Canva_whiteboard.jpg" target="_blank">whiteboard feature</a> that
allows users to plan out a design, with one element being the traditional box and line styled sitemap. Canva also has a website feature, allowing users without coding experience
to make websites with premade designs. Examples of Canva-made websites can be viewed <a href="https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/inspiration/canva-websites" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
       <p>Here are some screenshots from Canva, in addition to a video detailing the various webpage UX options:</p>
